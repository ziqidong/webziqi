my fisrt personnal website, just an attempt to practice vue.js

It's a static website constructed by vue.js, withoue data interchange between fonrt end and back end, i put some photos and my personnal information on it, i will add more modules in the days to come, like login, submit comments... these functions need database, back end support. The first step(static website) has been done, i use tencent cloud and nginx to deploy it, you can visit saltfishziqi.xyz to see the whole effect.

Next step i will use spring boot and spring security, mysql to develop back end support for my website.

At present it has three main function:
